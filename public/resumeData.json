    "bio": "Hi! I am Sukhbir Sekhon. (Try pronouncing my name) Well, there are a lot of things that I can talk about myself, but I want to start by telling you a little bit about my background. I was born in India and came to the United States at the age of 16. For 16 years, I lived in a competitive environment under a lot of pressure to get admission to the best engineering college. Long story short, I never completed my high school graduation in India and came to the US to continue my further education. I always wanted to pursue Mechanical Engineering, but I decided to pursue Information Technology in Software Development to learn and understand various aspects of technology.",
    "bio2": "So here I am pursuing double majors in Information Technology and MBA from the University of Cincinnati. I am currently working as a Software Developer and gaining valuable full stack developing experience from wonderful mentors. I am always looking forward to meeting wonderful tech-savvy people and expand my horizon in IT. You might wonder, why an MBA? Well, I have a lot of entrepreneur aspirations and at some point, in my career, I want to start my own business and move towards the business quadrant from the employee quadrant.",
    "bio3": "My goals are straight forward. Get good grades in college, gain valuable technical experience from my co-ops and internships, attain Microsoft certifications, invest and save money, and work with a big tech company, live a healthier lifestyle, spend time with family, make healthy relationships, and achieve fulfillment in whatever I do. I hope to make a positive impact on my society by solving real-world problems with the help of a technical mindset. I love to teach and educate my peers using my technical knowledge whether it is in college or at my workplace. I will continue helping others through whatever means I can!",
